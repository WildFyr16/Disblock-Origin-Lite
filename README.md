# Disblock Origin Lite

A fork of the ad-blocker "Theme" for Discord that hides all Nitro and "boost" upsells, built for people who still want to sue features of Discord.


## Installation

Use your favorite client mod (such as Vencord) to add the theme. You can use this URL, which mirrors the files on the repo:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WildFyr16/Disblock-Origin-Lite/main/DisblockOrigin.theme.css
```

![Install Example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6952b753-7c60-43de-8495-116233902263)


> [!NOTE]
> There are certain optional features at the end of the CSS you can change by uncommenting them. I am exploring ways to make these more accessible without having to change the CSS, but well here we are for now.


To see whether Disblock Origin Lite is properly installed, check for the logo at the bottom of the settings sidebar next to Discord's social logos, you should see a mauve Disblock Origin Lite logo to let you know it's working.
